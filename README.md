Code Written for BENG 181, taken at UCSD in Winter 2021

Naming for files based on assignments from this book: https://stepik.org/course/55789/promo

The above book isn't the exact stepik course used (the one used is restricted to UCSD students), but it's the same book that the material came from.
Naming is as follows: book_chapter_subsection_problem.R

There's also a file (book_functions.R) that has all functions comiled that I sourced in my code to reuse previously written code.

I did choose to do all of the code in R because, well, I like using R
